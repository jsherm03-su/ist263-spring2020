                            People at Uber have identified all the pain points people faced while hailing a cab- and they eliminated them one by one. No more painstaking anticipation while waiting for your cab because you know exactly where your ride is at any time and how much
                            it takes until it’s there. Moreover, enabling ratings for both users and drivers is a way of ensuring that their services will always meet their clients’ and their partners’ expectations.

                            It takes a lot to deliver the best customer experience to their guests. Young women who played Disney princesses at Disneyland revealed everything they went through in order to fulfill their dream of becoming their favorite characters. When they audition,
                            they don’t get to choose which princess they will play. If they want to play Cinderella but they are a better fit for Ariel or Belle, they will be cast as one of the latter. They have to be the right shape and the right size
                            and they go through an extensive training period during which they learn everything about their character. They need to act like that specific princess. Before being allowed to play their character, they spend some time as
                            a “fur character”, such as Mickey, Minnie or Pluto just to get accustomed to the atmosphere. During their time as princesses, they should personally greet no less than 172 guests per hour and entertain them accordingly.

                            Personalization is the key feature of their movie and series selection. When you register, you are able to use the platform for free during the first month. After that time, you can choose one of the three membership plans (basic, standard or premium)
                            or you can cancel your membership. The main advantage of video streaming platforms is that you can watch your favorite shows without being interrupted by commercial breaks. The possibility to download movies or episodes from
                            your favorite series to watch later, when there is no internet connection is also a big plus. The other advantage is related to the much wider range of productions they offer. Furthermore, when you create a profile on their
                            platform you can choose the titles you like most so that their algorithm figures out what suggestions are the best fit.
